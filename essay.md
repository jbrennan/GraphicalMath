Some ideas for the essay that will accompany the release of this project.

Doing with Images Makes Symbols
===============================

Alan Kay's big revelation was a simplification of Piaget which Alan succinctly put as:

>**Doing** with **Images** makes **Symbols**

That is, physically interacting with and manipulating visual things allows a person to create a symbolic mental model of what they're trying to accomplish.

Math, as it is presented to be learned today, deals almost exclusively in the realm of the Symbol, sparingly in the realm of the Image, and almost never in the realm of any kind of interactive manipulation (sure, you can manipulate the symbols, but they're still just symbols and they don't offer any kind of feedback).

Even though a symbolic, internalized knowledge of math is the desire, when beginning to come to an understanding of math, the Symbols we currently work with are **not** internalized to us, but to the others already familiar with math. We're trying to understand the symbols already present in the heads of others and internalize them likewise, but we're expected to do it by staring at those very symbols until something clicks.

1. Formula
2. Then a miracle happens.
3. It all makes sense!
